Trained on the MusicNet dataset, the model learned intricate patterns from classical music. Our training process involved extracting sequences of notes, using those to train the LSTM model, and then generating new music by predicting the next notes in the sequence. Alongside the model, we created an interactive website hosted on Amazon EC2 where users can select instruments and generate music in real-time.",
